# Device configuration

tinyTouch stores schema-6 configuration in ESP32 NVS. Invalid data resets to defaults.

## Firmware defaults and limits

| Setting | Default | Valid range |
|---|---:|---:|
| Mode | PIV | PIV or HID |
| Submit Enter after HID password | On | Off or on |
| HID typing delay | 7 ms | 1–100 ms |
| Touch cooldown | 800 ms | 100–5000 ms |
| HID computers | 0 | Up to 8 |
| Fingerprint slots | 0 | Slots 1–5 |

After enrollment, protected changes require a matching fingerprint.

## Sensor ring

The ring fades out after three seconds without a finger and lights up blue when
touched again. A touch also cancels a fade already in progress. Authentication
results show green or red briefly, then return to the idle lighting behavior.

## Fingerprint profile

Setup stores four views of one finger in slots 1–4. Slot 5 is available for manual enrollment.

```sh
tinytouch enroll 5
tinytouch delete 5
```

The sensor stores templates. ESP32 NVS doesn't store fingerprint data.

## HID hosts

Firmware supports eight HID hosts. Login Keychain stores each Mac's password and pairing key.

```sh
tinytouch computers
tinytouch computers remove HOST_ID
```

Removing the last host selects PIV mode.

## PIV state

`piv=ready` means the device has a private key and certificate. Run `sc_auth identities` to check macOS pairing.

## FIDO2 state

On the `feature/fido2` branch, `fido=ready` means the authenticator storage and
cryptography initialized successfully. `passkeys=N` counts discoverable
credentials, up to 16. These credentials use a separate `fido` NVS partition.
`fido=unavailable` can indicate an old partition table or invalid stored data;
the firmware preserves that data and keeps PIV available.

See [FIDO2 development firmware](/reference/fido2) for installation and protocol
support. Both an authorized factory reset and physical recovery clear FIDO2
credentials. A CTAP authenticator reset clears only FIDO2 credentials.

## macOS paths

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tinytouch.helper.plist` | HID background service |
| `~/Library/Application Support/tinyTouch/` | CLI bundles, helper coordination, replay state, and per-device settings |
| `~/Library/Logs/tinyTouch/helper.log` | HID helper standard output |
| `~/Library/Logs/tinyTouch/helper.err` | HID helper diagnostics |

Login Keychain stores secrets. Run setup on each Mac.

## Reset behavior

`tinytouch factory-reset` clears device state, local HID credentials, and PIV pairing. Browser recovery clears device state without normal authorization.

See [Recovery](/reference/recovery) for a comparison of each reset path.
